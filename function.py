# function = organizing the code, break up the code into smaller, more manageable and more maintainable containers.
# whenever you define a function, add 2 spaces
# always define your variables first before you call them

def greet_user(): # def = define
    print("Hi there!")
    print("Welcome aboard")


print("Start")
greet_user()
print("Finish")
